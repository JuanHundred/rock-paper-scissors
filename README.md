## Notes

This webpage was made using vanilla HTML,CSS, and JavaScript. This webpage is also mobile friendly. 
The only challenge I encountered when making the game/webpage was not knowing how to properly utilize the callback function when using the addEventListener function.
Utilizing an anonymous function to call the playRound function fixed the issue.
